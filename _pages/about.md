I am a first-year [MS student in Financial Economics](https://academics.business.columbia.edu/msfe) at [Columbia Business School](https://business.columbia.edu), actively seeking Summer 2025 internships in quantitative research and macro research. I earned dual Bachelorâ€™s degrees in Mathematics and Economics from Peking University. My academic background includes extensive research in finance and machine learning, equipping me with both market sense and analytical skill sets.
